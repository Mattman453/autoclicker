# autoclicker

To compile this project, 2 steps must be taken. In the root directory, create a directory named resources and place within it an ico file and a png file. These files must be named "mouse.ico" and "mouse.png". 

This project currently requires both to compile though this may be changed in the future to allow compilation without these files.
